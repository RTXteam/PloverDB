# PloverDB

Plover is a prototype **read-only in-memory database service** that can answer **one-hop queries** on a given biomedical knowledge graph (supplied in JSON [Biolink](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) format).

It accepts [TRAPI](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI) query graphs. More specifically, it can answer these kinds of queries:

1. **Single-hop**: `(>=1 curies)--[>=0 predicates]--(>=0 categories, >=0 curies)`
2. **Edge-less**: Consist only of `QNode`s (all of which must have curies specified)

It can answer queries in either an undirected (default) or directed fashion.

It returns the IDs of the nodes and edges comprising the answer to the query in the following format:
```
{
  "nodes":{
    "n00":[
      "CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL25"
    ],
    "n01":[
      "CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL833"
    ]
  },
  "edges":{
    "e00":[
      4831296,
      7234219,
      7233074,
    ]
  }
}
```
Where `n00`, `n01`, and `e00` are the `key`s of the `QNode`s/`QEdge`s in the submitted query graph.

In your JSON KG file, **required properties** for nodes/edges are:
* **Nodes**: `id` and some sort of `categories` property (specify its exact name in `kg_config.json`)
* **Edges**: `id`, `subject`, `object`, and some sort of `predicate` property (specify its exact name in `kg_config.json`)

All other node/edge properties will be ignored.

### How to run

##### To host the latest RTX-KG2c

_Hardware requirements_: A host machine with 128 GiB of memory is recommended for hosting [KG2c](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX/tree/master/code/kg2c) (we use an `r5a.4xlarge` Amazon EC2 instance). 100G of storage is sufficient.

1. Install Docker (if needed)
    * For Ubuntu 18, instructions are [here](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX-KG2/blob/master/install-docker-ubuntu18.sh)
    * For Mac, `brew install --cask docker` worked for me with macOS Big Sur
1. Make sure port `9990` (or one of your choosing) on your host machine is open if you're deploying the service somewhere (vs. just using it locally)
1. Clone this repo
1. `cd` into `PloverDB/`
1. Build your Docker image and run a container off of it:
    * `docker build -t yourimage .`
    * `docker run -d --name yourcontainer -p 9990:80 yourimage`

Building the image should take 20-30 minutes for KG2c. Upon starting the container, it will be a few minutes (appx. 5 minutes) until the app is fully loaded and ready for use; you can do `docker logs yourcontainer` to check on its progress.

Once it's finished loading, you should be able to send it POST requests at the port you opened; the URL for this would look something like: `http://yourinstance.rtx.ai:9990/query/`. Or, if you just want to use it locally: `http://localhost:9990/query/`.

##### To host your own KG file

Follow the same steps as above, but between steps 3 and 4, do the following within your clone of the repo:

1. Put your JSON KG file (which should be in Biolink format) into `PloverDB/app/`
1. Update `PloverDB/app/kg_config.json`:
    1. Specify your JSON KG file name under `local_kg_file_name` (e.g., `"my_kg.json"`)
    1. Set `remote_kg_file_name` to `null`
    1. Specify the 'labels' to use for nodes/edges (e.g., `"predicate"` and `"expanded_categories"`)

### How to test
To verify that your new service is working, you can run the pytest suite against it:
1. If you haven't already done so on the machine you'll be sending the tests from:
    1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
    1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `pytest -v test/test.py --endpoint [your_endpoint_url]`
    * Example endpoint URL: `http://kg2cplover.rtx.ai:9990`
    * If no endpoint is specified, the tests will use: `http://localhost:9990`

(Note that these tests are written for KG2c, so may not pass if you've hosted a knowledge graph other than KG2c.)

### Debugging
To see the logs (includes all components - uwsgi, etc.), run:
 ```
 docker logs mycontainer
```
If you want to save the contents of the log to a file locally, run:
```
docker logs mycontainer >& logs/mylog.log
```
